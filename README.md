# Minecraft WhatStudy #

If you're wondering what this is: I once joked about making a website that uses an authentication system by school to create a Minecraft server. I also wanted to try out Node a bit and I got it to work. It's not that useful though.

This repo contains the front- and backend to Minecraft WhatStudy. 
The frontend (client) is simple HTML+CSS+JS without any external dependencies.
The backend (server) uses Node.js Express with several dependencies.
